# Grafana to Matrix Webhook Adapter

This project is a bridge between Grafana Alerting and Matrix. It receives webhook notifications from Grafana, formats them, and forwards them to a specified Matrix room. It also supports advanced features like interactive silencing via Matrix reactions, configurable user mentions, and periodic alert summaries.

## Features

- **Grafana Webhook Support:** Handles webhooks from Grafana Unified Alerting (and legacy format).
- **Matrix Notifications:** Sends formatted HTML messages to a Matrix room with alert details (status, name, host, summary, links).
- **Alert Deduplication:** Tracks active alerts to minimize noise, only notifying on state changes or new firings.
- **Smart Mentions:**
  - Configurable mentions based on the alert's `host` label.
  - Supports different mention policies for `CRIT` and `WARN` severities.
  - Can delay mentions (e.g., only mention if active for X minutes) or mention immediately.
- **Interactive Silencing:**
  - React to an alert message in Matrix with 🔇 (or `:mute:`) to silence the alert in Grafana for 24 hours.
  - The bot confirms the silence with a ☑️ reaction and a message.
- **Periodic Summaries:**
  - Sends a digest of active alerts at specific scheduled times defined in UTC.
  - Helps keep track of long-running issues.
- **Persistence:** All internal state is stored in a SQLiteDB, allowing for restarts without a flood of messages during startup.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v22.5+)
- A Matrix account (bot user)
- A Grafana instance (for alerts and silencing API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables (via a `.env` file) or a JSON configuration file.

### JSON Configuration

By default, the application looks for a `config.json` file in the working directory. You can specify a custom config file using the `--config` argument:

```bash
npm start -- --config /path/to/my-config.json
```

or 

```bash
node src/index.js --config /path/to/my-config.json
```

### Environment Variables / Config Keys

Create a `.env` file in the root directory or use a JSON file with the following keys:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Matrix Configuration
MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL=https://matrix.org
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_matrix_access_token
MATRIX_ROOM_ID=!your_room_id:matrix.org

# Grafana Configuration (Required for Silencing)
GRAFANA_URL=https://your-grafana-instance.com
GRAFANA_API_KEY=your_grafana_api_key

# Mention Feature
MENTION_CONFIG_PATH=./mention-config.json
SUMMARY_SCHEDULE_CRIT=08:00,16:00  # UTC times
SUMMARY_SCHEDULE_WARN=08:00        # UTC times

# Storage
DB_FILE=alerts.db
```

Note that the room id is not the public name of a channel. 
To aid with the discovery of the correct room ID, the bot prints all rooms it has access to at startup.

### Mention Configuration (`mention-config.json`)

If you use `MENTION_CONFIG_PATH`, create a JSON file (e.g., `mention-config.json`) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "host-01": { // key needs to **exactly** match host label value
    "primary": ["@user1:matrix.org"],
    "secondary": ["@user2:matrix.org"],
    "delay_crit_primary": 0,    // 0 = Immediate
    "delay_warn_primary": 30,   // Mention after 30 mins
    "delay_crit_secondary": 60,
    "delay_warn_secondary": -1, // -1 = Never mention
    "repeat_crit_primary": 60,  // Repeat every 60m. null (default)=Every grafana summary, -1=Once
    "repeat_warn_primary": -1   // Mention once, do not repeat
  }
}
```

This mention config is reloaded when an alert fires and can therefore be updated while the bot runs.

## Running the Project

Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

On startup, the bot will log a list of joined rooms to the console, which helps you find the `MATRIX_ROOM_ID` if you don't have it.

## Docker

The application can be run as a container. Images are automatically built and published via GitHub Actions.

### Docker CLI

You can run the container directly, passing configuration via environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name grafana-to-matrix \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v $(pwd)/alerts.db:/app/alerts.db \
  -e MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e MATRIX_ROOM_ID=!your_room_id:matrix.org \
  ghcr.io/amaennel/grafana2matrix:latest
```

### Docker Compose

Alternatively, use `docker-compose.yml` for a more persistent setup:

```yaml
services:
  grafana-to-matrix:
    image: ghcr.io/amaennel/grafana2matrix:latest
    container_name: grafana-to-matrix
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./alerts.db:/app/alerts.db
      - ./config.json:/app/config.json:ro
      # - ./mention-config.json:/app/mention-config.json:ro
    environment:
      - MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL=https://matrix.org
      - MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
      - MATRIX_ROOM_ID=!your_room_id:matrix.org
      - GRAFANA_URL=https://your-grafana-instance.com
      - GRAFANA_API_KEY=your_grafana_api_key
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run it with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Usage

1. **Configure Grafana:**
   - In Grafana Alerting -> Contact Points, add a new contact point of type **Webhook**.
   - Set the URL to `http://your-bot-host:3000/webhook`.
2. **Receive Alerts:**
   - When an alert fires, you will see a message in the Matrix room.
3. **Silence Alerts:**
   - React to the alert message with the 🔇 emoji.
   - The bot will call the Grafana API to create a silence and confirm in the chat.

## Chat Commands

The bot supports the following commands in the Matrix room:

- **`.summary <severity>`**: Manually triggers an alert summary for the specified severity.
  - Example: `.summary CRITICAL` or `.summary WARNING`
- **`.reload-config`**: Reloads the configuration from disk (both `.env` and `config.json`) without restarting the process. Useful for updating mention configurations or schedules on the fly.


## Alert Labels

To take full advantage of the bot's features, your Grafana alerts should include the following labels:

- `host` or `instance`: Used to identify the affected system. The `host` label is specifically used for matching entries in `mention-config.json`.
- `severity`: Used for smart mentions and periodic summaries. The bot looks for `CRIT`/`CRITICAL` or `WARN`/`WARNING` (case-insensitive).

Annotations like `summary`, `description`, or `message` are also supported and will be included in the Matrix notification body if present.

Note that Grafana sends only the labels that were used during the alert query. In case of a `severity` label,
this should be added as an annotation to the alert (point 5 in the grafana alert UI).
