# Grafana to Matrix Webhook Adapter

This project is a bridge between Grafana Alerting and Matrix. It receives webhook notifications from Grafana, formats them, and forwards them to a specified Matrix room. It also supports advanced features like interactive silencing via Matrix reactions, configurable user mentions, and periodic alert summaries.

## Features

- **Grafana Webhook Support:** Handles webhooks from Grafana Unified Alerting (and legacy format).
- **Matrix Notifications:** Sends formatted HTML messages to a Matrix room with alert details (status, name, host, summary, links).
- **Alert Deduplication:** Tracks active alerts to minimize noise, only notifying on state changes or new firings.
- **Smart Mentions:**
  - Configurable mentions based on the alert's `host` label.
  - Supports different mention policies for `CRIT` and `WARN` severities.
  - Can delay mentions (e.g., only mention if active for X minutes) or mention immediately.
- **Interactive Silencing:**
  - React to an alert message in Matrix with 🔇 (or `:mute:`) to silence the alert in Grafana for 24 hours.
  - The bot confirms the silence with a ☑️ reaction and a message.
- **Periodic Summaries:**
  - Sends a digest of active alerts at configurable intervals (e.g., every 2 hours for CRIT, 4 hours for WARN).
  - Helps keep track of long-running issues.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- A Matrix account (bot user)
- A Grafana instance (for alerts and silencing API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Matrix Configuration
MATRIX_HOMESERVER_URL=https://matrix.org
MATRIX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_matrix_access_token
MATRIX_ROOM_ID=!your_room_id:matrix.org

# Grafana Configuration (Required for Silencing)
GRAFANA_URL=https://your-grafana-instance.com
GRAFANA_API_KEY=your_grafana_api_key

# Advanced Features
MENTION_CONFIG_PATH=./mention-config.json
SUMMARY_INTERVAL_CRIT_MS=7200000  # 2 hours in ms
SUMMARY_INTERVAL_WARN_MS=14400000 # 4 hours in ms
```

### Mention Configuration (`mention-config.json`)

If you use `MENTION_CONFIG_PATH`, create a JSON file (e.g., `mention-config.json`) with the following structure:

```json
{
  "host-01": {
    "primary": ["@user1:matrix.org"],
    "secondary": ["@user2:matrix.org"],
    "delay_crit_primary": 0,    // 0 = Immediate
    "delay_warn_primary": 30,   // Mention after 30 mins
    "delay_crit_secondary": 60,
    "delay_warn_secondary": -1  // -1 = Never mention
  }
}
```

## Running the Project

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

On startup, the bot will log a list of joined rooms to the console, which helps you find the `MATRIX_ROOM_ID` if you don't have it.

## Usage

1. **Configure Grafana:**
   - In Grafana Alerting -> Contact Points, add a new contact point of type **Webhook**.
   - Set the URL to `http://your-bot-host:3000/webhook`.
2. **Receive Alerts:**
   - When an alert fires, you will see a message in the Matrix room.
3. **Silence Alerts:**
   - React to the alert message with the 🔇 emoji.
   - The bot will call the Grafana API to create a silence and confirm in the chat.

## Alert Labels

To take full advantage of the bot's features, your Grafana alerts should include the following labels:

- `alertname`: (Required) The name of the alert, used as the message title.
- `host` or `instance`: (Recommended) Used to identify the affected system. The `host` label is specifically used for matching entries in `mention-config.json`.
- `severity`: (Recommended) Used for smart mentions and periodic summaries. The bot looks for `CRIT`/`CRITICAL` or `WARN`/`WARNING` (case-insensitive).

Annotations like `summary`, `description`, or `message` are also supported and will be included in the Matrix notification body if present.
